# Trends between US Births and Mother's Education

The following dataset provides information related to births (baby weight and number) in the United States from 2016 to 2021. Specifically, it includes information on the mother including the mother's age and education level. The data was sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The weight of a baby can be a determinant on the baby's future physical development. They typical range of a healthy baby is between 2.50 - 4 grams, however there are some studies that suggest that heavier babies tend to do better in school. This project aims to uncover some correlations between mother's education level and baby weight.
